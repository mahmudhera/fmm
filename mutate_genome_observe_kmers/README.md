In this folder we will:

1. mutate a known genome using the mutation model, and return the mutated genome string, all its kmers, and
    - kmers with a single substitution
    - kmers with a single deletion
    - kmers with a single insertion
    - kmers that did not experience any mutation
1. then, using just the kmers, we will want to observe these four quantities
1. after everything, we will store all mutated genomes, the mutation parameters, eight observations, and four expected values
1. finally we will plot against the known expected values
